/* The clock behind host.c's rt_clock_ns (included there once; tools/dev/clocktest.c checks it).
 *
 * What tells time asks it: the game's system tick, the kernel's timeouts, rt_now_ns and the
 * renderer's own timing (twice a draw) - tens of thousands of times a second. That is
 * QueryPerformanceCounter, some 20 ns a call, except on a PC that Windows was told to time
 * with the HPET (bcdedit useplatformclock, a common "tweak") or the ACPI timer: there a call
 * takes a microsecond or more, and a player's 8-fighter match spent some 40% of the game's
 * main thread in it. So a slow one is measured at start and, where the CPU's time stamp
 * counter runs at a constant rate (CPUID: invariant TSC - x64 CPUs of the last decade), that
 * counter is read instead, scaled to the same nanoseconds: measured against the system timer
 * at start, and again after a few seconds, half a minute and ten minutes, each time from
 * where the clock stands then (it never steps back). SSBU_CLOCK=qpc or tsc picks one.
 *
 * On arm64 (the macOS port) there is nothing to switch to: the system timer is the processor's
 * own counter there (mach_absolute_time, a few nanoseconds a read, at a constant rate), so it
 * is always the one, and only x64 builds have the time stamp counter's part.
 *
 * Needs <windows.h> (or the Linux port's) first. */
