# Three games on this PC in the online lobby (tools/ssbu_relay.py, run here on loopback): Alpha
# and Bravo each create a Local Wireless room, Charlie opens the Rooms List - which must show
# both - and joins the first. Menus only (no battle), no router or firewall change.
# Usage: tools/dev/netlobby.sh <out prefix> [seconds]
#   SSBU_EXE (default build/ssbu.exe), SSBU_LOBBY_PORT (39510), SSBU_CAPTURE_MAX (80, Charlie's frames)
#   SSBU_LOBBY=host:port: use that lobby (e.g. the online one) instead of starting one here
#   SSBU_INPUT_HOST, SSBU_INPUT_JOIN: the scripted input of the hosts and of Charlie (defaults:
#     11.0.0's menus - Local Wireless, create a room; Rooms List, first room)
#   SSBU_KEEP=1: keep Charlie's frames (<out>-charlie/) instead of deleting them at the end
#   SSBU_DIRECT_TEST: which direct connection run (every game on 127.0.0.1 with its own port,
#     each filtering like a router: SSBU_NET_TEST_NAT=1)
#     (default)  Alpha and Charlie connect directly; at about 95 s Charlie's direct path is cut
#                (SSBU_NET_TEST_BLOCK) and both must go on through the lobby - 125 s
#     blocked    Charlie's direct packets are dropped from the start (as a symmetric NAT): both
#                must give up punching and play through the lobby
#     off        Charlie turns direct connections off (SSBU_NET_DIRECT=0): the lobby must never
#                introduce it, nor give Alpha its address
#     three      Alpha hosts, Bravo and Charlie both join it (two stations: their own pair too) - 125 s
#     none       no direct connection checks
# Logs: <out>-lobby.log, <out>-alpha.log, -bravo.log, -charlie.log. Prints PASS or FAIL.
